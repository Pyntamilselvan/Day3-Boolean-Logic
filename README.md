## ✅ Topics Practiced

// Boolean Identities Used:
A + 0 = A // Identity Law
A · 1 = A // Identity Law
A + A' = 1 // Complement Law
A · A' = 0 // Complement Law
A + AB = A // Absorption Law
A(B + C) = AB + AC // Distributive Law

// Expressions Solved:
Z = A + AB => A
Z = AB + A'B => B
Z = AB + AB' => A
Z = A + A'B => A + B
Z = AB + AB' + A'B => A + B
Z = AB + AC + BC => AB + C(A ⊕ B)

## 🧠 Truth Table Practice (Written by Hand)

/*  
All expressions were tested with full binary input combinations.  
Manually verified results by constructing truth tables on paper.
